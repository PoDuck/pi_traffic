# pi_traffic
Control software to allow raspberry pi to control traffic signal lights, as well as be responsive to music.

To use this, all configuration is done in the **config.py** file.  The most important setting is the SEQUENCE variable.  With those settings, it is possible to override all other settings.  It determines how many lights will be controlled, their duration, and the delay before they start.
